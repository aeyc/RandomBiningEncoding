TASK 2

For task 2 we have developed a python script. It gets from keyboard input a three bit string (plaintext),
and append a 0 to it. Then it pass the four bit strig to an encoding function that calculates three parity bits
according to hamming (7,4). it enqueue these new bits to the plaintext. it then calculates the
binary complement and select a random int from set {0,1}, if the random number is equal to 0
it prints the original ciphertext, otherwise it prints its binary complement.

TASK 3 
For task 3 we have developed a python script. It gets from keyboard input a seven bit string (ciphertext),
it calculates the syndrome, according to hamming (7,4), from the last three bits of the string.
Then comparing the value of the sindrome we can understan if the message has an error in one bit 
or if it is correct. If the syndrome is equal to six there is an error in the first bit (the most significant one),
If the syndrome is equal to five there is an error in the second bit, If the syndrome is equal to three there is an error in the third bit,
If the syndrome is equal to seven there is an error in the fourth bit. For other values of the syndrome it means
that there is no error or it is in the parity bit. It correct the error if present. Checks if
the first bit is equal to 1, if it is, it prints the binary complement of bits 2-4 (considering bits
numered as 1-7), if it is equal to 0 it print bits 2-4 as they are.
